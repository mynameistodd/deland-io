                I'm an engineer and developer who loves to tinker with
                technology. I admit I'm definitely not a designer, but I do
                appreciate clean, effective software.

                My professional life is driven by curiosity and a desire to
                build things that work well. I enjoy diving deep into new tech,
                understanding how systems operate, and solving interesting
                problems.

                When I'm not at the keyboard, I'm usually wearing a different
                hat: Dad, Scout Leader, or avid innovative media consumer. I
                love a good TV show or movie—especially if it involves a complex
                heist.
