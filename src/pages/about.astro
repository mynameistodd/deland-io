                    I'm a developer and designer passionate about building
                    clean, efficient, and beautiful web experiences.

                    My journey started with a curiosity for how things work on
                    the internet. Over the years, I've honed my skills in modern
                    web technologies, focusing on performance and accessibility.

                    When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new coffee
                    shops, reading about design trends, or tinkering with new
                    tech.
