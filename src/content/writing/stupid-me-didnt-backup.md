Well stupid me didn't backup like I should have when I started the wordpress upgrade. I followed the directions, and deleted the wp-content/uploads folder which had all of my uploads from various posts.   To further disappointment I haven't done any backups of my site at my hosting company. I put in an email and hopefully they will be able to recover something for me, but if not that is ok. My own fault. :(
