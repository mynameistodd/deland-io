Trying to resize a DS virtual machine (VM) in Azure wasn’t immediately intuitive to me. Turns out you can only do this in the new Preview portal. And it’s pretty easy.

1.  Go to your preview portal, in the Virtual Machines section and view the blade for the VM.
2.  Click on the **Pricing Tier** tile under Usage.
3.  Select and save. This will definitely reboot the machine. Be careful!
