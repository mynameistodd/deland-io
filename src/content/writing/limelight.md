Limelight  is a type of stage lighting once used in theatres and music halls. An intense illumination is created when an oxyhydrogen flame is directed at a cylinder of calcium oxide,[citation needed] which can be raised to white heat without melting. The light is produced by a combination of incandescence and candoluminescence.[citation needed] Although it has long since been replaced by electric lighting, the term has nonetheless survived, as someone in the public eye is still said to be “in the limelight”.
