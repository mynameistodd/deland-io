“5. “Archive and next” shortcut We added a bunch of new shortcuts to Gmail, but one that I’ve found to be a true time-saver is what I call the “archive and next” shortcut. When I have a lot of mail, it can be really annoying to have to open a message, click “Back to Inbox” and then select the next email I want to read. So once you enable shortcuts in Settings, you can simply press the left bracket key “[” while viewing a message to archive it, and then immediately open the next oldest one. When I see a long list of unread messages, I like to open the first one and then just hit “[” to swiftly move through my mail and archive as I go. (P.S. By clicking the right bracket “]” you can also move the other way if you want to open newer messages after you archive).” — Official Gmail Blog: 5 little-known Gmail features you may not yet know about
