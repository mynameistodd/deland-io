I found this great article  straight from the Google Calendar Help . I have this problem of syncing. We all do. But follow this help article to get your calendars two-way syncing with ical and Google Calendar (gCal) using webdav. Its simple to do and keeps things in sync, even on my iphone! Down side is that I still can only create to-do's in my local ical calendar as well as from my iphone, but I'm working on an automated solution to copy my events from my local calendar to my main google calendar. But the interface from ical is great and doesn't require the use of Spanning Sync  or BusySync  which I was considering. Enter comments below!
