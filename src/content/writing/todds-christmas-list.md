Here is my Christmas list, send me yours! Any good action/suspense/thriller/comedy movies such as The Departed Shooter Breach WarGames Saw I, II, III, IV (they are sooo good) Etc. My favorite TV shows are Lost Heroes Bluetooth GPS receiver, just a receiver I can "pair" with my MacBook Pro (which in turn uses Google Earth) and/or a future phone (aka iPhone). Usually around 40-50 bucks, usually no display on the device. Nothing as good as dad's GPS. ThinkGeek.com T-Shirts and stuff that's neat from there. Magnetic knife rack for the kitchen (for my spiffy cutco knives) Tie rack Coffee table to go with our new furniture! Anything to help fill up my cube at work Bose headphones Over ear, on ear, or earbuds...not sure. Tuna Macaroni once a month Snowmobiling helmet Rope bag for my climbing rope I recently got That's it for now...I'll add to the list when I think of things!
