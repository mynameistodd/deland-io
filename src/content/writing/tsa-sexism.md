Thought this was rather humorous of the TSA. This one's for you Adam. Two links to videos on the TSA website. http://www.tsa.gov/assets/mov/passenger_guidance_business_man.wmv http://www.tsa.gov/assets/mov/passenger_guidance_business_woman.wmv Notice the difference in that the man has a laptop and the woman doesn't and that the man would have shoes to be screened and the woman would not. I thought women were equals now, might they have a laptop too? Right TSA? :-)
