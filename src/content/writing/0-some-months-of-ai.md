I have no clue why, but this year, I decided I wanted to write 12 posts. Maybe about AI, maybe not.

The first post (this one), I’m going to use three different GenAI tools to help me figure out the 12 posts I want to write. ChatGPT, Copilot, Gemini. So, here we go…

### The Prompt

It’s that time of the year again. A time for inspiration, a time for everything new, it’s the beginning of a new year! And with a new year comes new goals. You are an expert recommendation engine, I am a technologist at heart with an interest stemming from Software Engineering, needing to stay on top of a variety of trendy topics, such as GenAI and agentic AI.
