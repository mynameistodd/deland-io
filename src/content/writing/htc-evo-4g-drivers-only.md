How to install drivers only for HTC EVO 4g on Windows 7 x64 &nbsp; Download HTC Sync from HTC’s support site http://www.htc.com/us/support/evo-sprint/downloads/ &nbsp; Do a “custom” install and deselect both "Application Installer” and “Sync Manager”. Click next and allow to install. This installed HTC Sync (boo) and the driver. &nbsp; Uninstall HTC Sync from Programs and Features, this leaves just the driver in place. Check with the command “adb devices” from your android SDK install location.
