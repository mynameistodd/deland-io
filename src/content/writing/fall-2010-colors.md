  Jessica, Riley and I went out for a great walk yesterday around some parks in Ann Arbor! We first visited Bird Hills, where most of these were taken. Riley did such a good job "off leash" in the beginning of the walk, but then later on he got a little too sure of himself and ran away! Jessica and I looked for him for about 15 minutes before another nice couple found him. He scared us!  Later on we went to Island Park, walked around a bit, went over the bridge to Fuller Park and checked out that one. By that time it was nearly 3:30 so we decided to drive down Main St., past the Big House and see all the crazy people! Check out the My Tracks for the last piece of the day!
