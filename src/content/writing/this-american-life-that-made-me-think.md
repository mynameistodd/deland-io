I subscribe to the podcast "This American Life." Usually I just listen while I'm working in the morning over a cup of coffee. Its a good break from NPR.   Episode 223: Classifieds, grabbed my attention as it is talking about newspaper classifieds which my company creates software for both print and online publications.   Its a good listen, here .
